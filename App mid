The first half of the year marked significant progress across multiple initiatives, most notably the successful submission of the white paper for Project Chromium Kavach. This effort led to the development of an AI and NLP-powered extension that automates the identification of deprecated or removed features from Chromium release notes. Additionally, it scans source code repositories (e.g., GitHub) to detect updated features at the code level. Aligned with the vision of establishing a standardized baseline manifest, this innovation is currently in the patent filing stage.

To ensure timely delivery and knowledge sharing, junior team members were actively involved in development, while additional contributors were engaged to streamline the workload. The concept and working prototype were showcased across multiple forums, including leadership visits to India and internal strategic discussions, receiving encouraging feedback and support.

Another major deliverable involved enabling Google Chrome on Ubuntu-based containers for the EPLX team. Despite the complexity of introducing a new browser runtime in containerized environments, the feature was successfully implemented through coordinated cross-team efforts. Though the EPLX team later adopted an alternative solution, the work done provides a valuable framework for future container-based browser use cases.

Efforts to support Windows 11 migration included the expedited packaging of Adobe Reader with baseline configurations via CSP INI. Upon identifying issues with Samantha settings, the team incorporated all configurations directly into the package to ensure stability and compliance.

In response to a security concern raised by the Threat Detection team—regarding the presence of unauthorized Chrome extensions despite existing GPO and Intune policies—a multi-team investigation was initiated. Root cause analysis involved coordination with Tanium, Proxy Engineering, and other security stakeholders. Although the extensions did not violate current policy, a cleanup plan and policy updates were defined to restrict browser sign-in and remove unsupported extensions. Implementation is currently in progress.

The increasing demand for Firefox on Windows 11 led to the creation of an updated browser baseline and engagement with packaging teams. This project is currently under review by the EXXX team for deployment readiness.

Throughout the reporting period, four zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Chrome and Firefox were mitigated within SLA, maintaining a strong security posture across the environment.

Under the ongoing n-2 release optimization program, a strategy was proposed to enable monthly releases for key products. While Chrome and Firefox are already aligned to this cadence, Adobe Reader presented challenges due to packaging delays in Windows 11 environments. A new security baseline was created and is now undergoing UAT testing to enable consistent monthly releases of both Adobe Reader and Acrobat.




Product Ownership and Team Leadership

As part of product ownership, coordinated efforts across teams, tools, and processes have ensured consistent and timely product delivery. Stewards were mentored through regular knowledge-sharing and review sessions, enabling them to manage the lifecycle independently and effectively.

With increasing risk and compliance requirements, automation has been a key focus. An internal release tracking system was developed to streamline version management and reduce manual effort, with plans to expand automation further.

Efficient time management and strong collaboration with stewards have been instrumental. Support was also extended to initiatives like the EMIE Site List cloud migration, reinforcing a leadership approach centered on enabling, guiding, and empowering others rather than directing tasks hands-on.


Security Baseline and Documentation Updates
------
The Mozilla Firefox baseline documentation was thoroughly revamped, with minimal dependency on security teams. The team handled multiple revisions to align with compliance standards, successfully completing the effort with internal collaboration. Security reviews for Chrome and Adobe Reader are ongoing, with implementation expected to begin in the upcoming months, marking a more execution-driven second half of the year.
