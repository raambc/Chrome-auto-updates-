Title: AI/ML-Based Automated Chromium Browser Change Management System

1. Brief Description of the Invention

This invention introduces an automated system that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and manage updates in Chromium-based browsers. The system proactively identifies changes in browser release notes, assesses their impact on web applications, and communicates necessary updates to developers. It predicts potential issues caused by browser updates and suggests code modifications before the actual deployment of these updates, thus minimizing application downtime.

2. Structure and Function of the Invention

Structure:

The invention consists of the following key components:

1. Data Collection Module: Scrapes and retrieves data from Chromium release notes, roadmaps, and update announcements.


2. NLP/LLM-Based Analysis Module: Processes the collected data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and Llama-2.


3. Ruleset Generation Module: Generates a comprehensive ruleset outlining upcoming, deprecated, and modified features based on the analysis.


4. Code Analysis Module: Integrates with GitHub repositories via API to analyze enterprise code against the generated ruleset.


5. Web Subscription Framework: Provides a user interface for developers to subscribe, access reports, and receive alerts about necessary code changes.


6. Recommendation Module: Offers suggested code changes and potential automated fixes based on detected issues.


7. Review and Validation Module: Engages human review for validating automated recommendations to ensure accuracy.



Function:

The system continuously monitors Chromium's updates, preemptively identifies potential disruptions in web applications, and provides early notifications to development teams. The automated analysis and rule matching reduce manual efforts, expedite the resolution of compatibility issues, and enhance overall software stability.

3. Novel Features and Differences from Prior Solutions

Novel Features:

1. Proactive Issue Identification: The system predicts potential application issues before they occur by analyzing upcoming changes in browser release notes.


2. AI/ML Integration: Utilizes advanced NLP and ML models for precise semantic analysis of release notes and application code, reducing the risk of manual oversight.


3. Automated Code Analysis: Integrates with GitHub to automatically compare enterprise code against generated rulesets, highlighting discrepancies and suggesting fixes.


4. Web Subscription Framework: Offers a user-friendly interface for developers to access insights and recommendations in real-time.


5. Scalability and Extensibility: The methodology can be applied beyond Chromium, adapting to other browsers and software ecosystems.



Differences from Existing Solutions:

Traditional approaches to browser updates rely on manual review and reactive problem-solving, often resulting in application downtime. Existing tools focus on patch management and manual testing, lacking predictive capabilities. This invention differentiates itself by providing an automated, predictive, and proactive solution, enabling developers to address potential issues at the development stage itself.

4. Problem Addressed by the Invention

Frequent updates in Chromium-based browsers introduce new features, modify existing functionalities, or deprecate outdated ones, posing significant challenges to developers. These updates can disrupt web applications, causing functionality issues that are often identified only after deployment. The manual process of reviewing release notes and identifying potential issues is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to prolonged downtimes and reduced application performance. The proposed invention solves this problem by automating the identification, analysis, and communication of relevant changes, allowing developers to take corrective actions early in the development cycle.

5. Alternative Methods

Several alternative methods could be considered to address the problem of managing browser updates:

1. Manual Review and Testing: Developers could manually review release notes and test their applications against upcoming browser changes. However, this method is labor-intensive and often misses edge cases due to the sheer volume of updates.


2. Static Code Analysis Tools: Standard code analysis tools could be used to scan the codebase for issues related to deprecated features. However, these tools do not typically consider the dynamic and evolving nature of browser updates.


3. Patch Management Systems: Implementing traditional patch management systems could help in managing updates. However, these systems usually focus on applying updates rather than predicting their impact, resulting in a reactive rather than proactive approach.


4. Vendor Collaboration: Engaging with browser vendors to receive early access to updates and detailed documentation might help anticipate changes. However, this method depends heavily on vendor cooperation and is not scalable across multiple software platforms.



6. Future Extensions and Enhancements

The underlying methodology of this invention offers numerous avenues for future enhancements:

1. Support for Multiple Browsers: Extend the solution to include analysis and change management for other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Edge.


2. Broader Software Ecosystem Integration: Apply the methodology to other software products beyond browsers, such as operating systems, APIs, or cloud platforms, enabling developers to manage updates across diverse environments.


3. Enhanced AI Models: Incorporate more advanced AI models, such as Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT-4), for improved semantic understanding and recommendation accuracy.


4. Automated Fix Implementation: Develop capabilities for the system to automatically apply suggested code changes, streamlining the remediation process further.


5. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines: Incorporate the tool into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for real-time monitoring and automatic application of changes during the build process.


6. Real-time Collaboration Features: Introduce collaboration features that allow multiple development teams to review, discuss, and implement recommended changes collectively through the platform.
