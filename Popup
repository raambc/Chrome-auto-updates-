how to create a Intune policy that create an URL ( https://localhost/path) to add in allow popup list. please note localhost should be computer name of each computer

To create an Intune policy that adds a URL (e.g., `https://localhost/path`) to the allow pop-up list in Microsoft Edge, where `localhost` dynamically resolves to the computer name of each device, follow these steps:

---

### **Steps to Configure Intune Policy for Pop-Up Allow List**

1. **Sign in to Microsoft Intune Admin Portal**:
   - Navigate to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

2. **Create a New Configuration Profile**:
   - Go to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create Profile**.
   - Select **Platform**: Windows 10 and later.
   - Choose **Profile Type**: Settings Catalog.

3. **Add Settings for Pop-Up Allow List**:
   - In the **Settings Catalog**, search for `Allow Popups`.
   - Select the relevant setting under Microsoft Edge policies.

4. **Specify the URL with Dynamic Computer Name**:
   - Use a dynamic variable for the computer name in the URL format. For example:
     ```
     https://%COMPUTERNAME%/path
     ```
   - `%COMPUTERNAME%` is a placeholder that resolves to the actual computer name of each device.

5. **Save and Assign the Policy**:
   - Configure scope tags if necessary.
   - Assign the policy to a device group or user group.
   - Click **Create** to deploy the policy.

### **Using OMA-URI for Advanced Configuration**
If you need more granular control, you can use an OMA-URI setting:

1. Add a custom configuration profile in Intune.
2. Use the following OMA-URI path:
   ```
   ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Edge/PopupsAllowedForUrls
   ```
3. Set the value as:
   ```json
   ["https://%COMPUTERNAME%/path"]
   ```

---

### **Notes:**
- Ensure that `localhost` dynamically resolves to the computer name by using `%COMPUTERNAME%`.
- Test this configuration in a lab environment before deploying it organization-wide.
- Restart Microsoft Edge on devices after applying the policy for changes to take effect[6].

This approach ensures that every device dynamically uses its own hostname in the allowed pop-up list.
