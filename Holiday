To add a holiday from a .hol file to your Outlook calendar using PowerShell, you can use the following script. This assumes you have the .hol file ready and want to import it.

Script to Add Holidays from .hol File

# Define the path to the .hol file
$holFilePath = "C:\Path\To\Your\File.hol"

# Check if the file exists
if (Test-Path -Path $holFilePath) {
    Write-Output "Importing holidays from $holFilePath..."

    # Launch Outlook COM object
    $outlook = New-Object -ComObject Outlook.Application
    $namespace = $outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

    # Import holidays
    try {
        $namespace.ImportHolidayFile($holFilePath)
        Write-Output "Holidays successfully imported!"
    } catch {
        Write-Output "An error occurred: $_"
    }
} else {
    Write-Output "The .hol file does not exist at the specified path."
}

Steps:

1. Prepare the .hol file:

A .hol file contains holiday data in a structured format (e.g., [Country/Region] followed by holiday dates).



2. Update the File Path:

Replace "C:\Path\To\Your\File.hol" with the actual path to your .hol file.



3. Run the Script:

Save the script in a .ps1 file and execute it in PowerShell.




Notes:

Ensure Outlook is installed and properly configured on the system where you are running the script.

The .hol file format should comply with Outlook's expected structure.

Run PowerShell as an administrator if necessary.
