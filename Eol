Subject: Preparation for Adobe Reader 2020 Classic End-of-Life (EOL) – Action Required

Dear [Stakeholders],

Adobe has announced that Adobe Reader 2020 Classic will reach End of Life (EOL) on June 1, 2025. After this date, Adobe will no longer provide security updates, patches, or technical support, which could pose security and operational risks if not addressed in advance.

To ensure a smooth transition and avoid last-minute challenges, we need to start planning now. Key areas requiring immediate attention include:

1. Identifying Dependencies – Assess applications, workflows, and business processes that rely on Adobe Reader 2020 Classic.


2. Notifying Impacted Teams – Ensure relevant teams and end-users are aware of the upcoming EOL and its implications.


3. Migration Planning – Evaluate transitioning to Adobe Reader DC or other viable alternatives.


4. Vendor Engagement – If any third-party applications depend on Adobe Reader Classic, initiate discussions with vendors regarding compatibility and support.


5. Software Development Considerations – Assess whether any internal applications need updates or modifications to function with newer PDF solutions.


6. Budgeting & Procurement – If licensing costs are involved in the migration, plan and allocate the necessary budget.


7. Exception Handling – Identify any critical use cases that may require an extended support plan or alternative solutions.



We request each stakeholder to engage with their respective teams to evaluate the impact, initiate necessary discussions, and define a transition plan. Kindly provide an update on the assessment and planned actions by [proposed deadline] to ensure we are well-prepared ahead of the EOL date.

For any queries or escalations, please reach out to [contact person/team].
