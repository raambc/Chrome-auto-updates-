Root Cause Analysis (Update)

Based on the details provided and the findings so far, the primary issue involves 5% of machines receiving Google Chrome updates directly from Google instead of through Microsoft Endpoint Manager Configuration Manager (MEMCM), despite a policy being in place to prevent this. Additionally, Group Policy processing delays have been identified on these machines, particularly related to Citrix and registry extensions. Below is a summarized root cause analysis:

Root Cause Factors Identified

1. Citrix Group Policy Extension Delays (Event ID 5016)

Cause: Citrix Group Policy extension is taking an excessively long time to process on the affected machines (633,719 milliseconds). This delay in policy processing might be preventing timely application of key group policies, including the one that disables Chrome auto-updates.

Impact: Due to this delay, the affected machines could bypass the MEMCM Chrome update management, allowing updates to be triggered directly from Google before the policy is enforced.



2. Registry Group Policy Extension Delays (Event ID 5016)

Cause: The registry group policy extension is also experiencing significant delays (620,016 milliseconds). This suggests that policies involving registry modifications, such as those controlling Chrome’s auto-update settings, are being applied very slowly or not at all.

Impact: The delay in applying registry-related policies could result in Chrome’s update settings not being correctly configured to prevent direct updates from Google.



3. Google Update Service Still Active

Cause: Despite MEMCM managing updates, the Google Update service (GoogleUpdate.exe) may still be active on the affected machines. This would allow Chrome to check and install updates directly from Google, bypassing MEMCM.

Impact: If this service is running, it overrides the MEMCM update policy, causing Chrome to update directly from Google.



4. Group Policy Application Delays

Cause: Both Citrix and registry-related group policies are taking significantly longer than expected to apply. This could be due to:

Network latency or communication issues with domain controllers.

Corrupted or overly complex group policies that increase processing time.


Impact: The overall delay in applying policies could allow Chrome to update from Google before the policy to disable updates is applied, leading to inconsistent update behavior.



5. Inconsistent Policy Synchronization

Cause: There might be inconsistencies or delays in the way MEMCM or Group Policy updates are synchronized on the affected machines. Issues with the MEMCM client or network connectivity could result in some machines not receiving or processing updates in a timely manner.

Impact: If the MEMCM client is not functioning properly or if there are network-related delays, policies may not apply as expected, leading to Chrome updates being processed directly from Google.




Contributing Factors

High Group Policy Processing Time: Excessive time to process group policies, especially Citrix and registry-related ones, is delaying the enforcement of the policy preventing Chrome auto-updates.

Potential Active Google Update Service: If the Google Update service is not fully disabled, it can cause Chrome to bypass MEMCM and fetch updates from Google's servers.

Local Configuration Conflicts: Local registry settings or other local configurations might be overriding MEMCM and group policies, allowing Chrome to update despite the policy settings.


Next Steps

1. Resolve Citrix and Registry Group Policy Processing Delays:

Review and optimize Citrix and registry-related group policies to reduce processing time.

Investigate network and domain controller performance to ensure timely group policy application.



2. Disable Google Update Service:

Ensure the Google Update service is disabled or stopped on all machines, either through group policy, MEMCM, or a custom script.



3. Monitor and Force Group Policy Application:

Force a group policy update on the affected machines using gpupdate /force and verify that the policies are applying correctly.

Regularly monitor group policy application times to ensure delays are mitigated.



4. Ensure MEMCM Client Health:

Verify that the MEMCM client is functioning properly on all machines. Reinstall or repair the client on affected machines if needed.




This update highlights key contributing factors and provides action points to resolve the issue, focusing on improving group policy processing and ensuring Chrome update control through MEMCM.
