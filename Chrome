The group policy processing delays, particularly involving Citrix and registry-related policies, are contributing to the bypass of Chrome update management GPOs on affected machines. These delays allow Chrome to initiate direct updates from Google before the policy can take effect. Several potential causes have been identified, including excessive usage of WMI queries within policies, WMI-related issues, and application configurations that depend on WMI, as indicated by event log 1035. Additionally, Live Client VDIs that have undergone multiple Windows service upgrades tend to consume more CPU cycles, which can further slow down policy application.

The issue is complex and not directly tied to a single cause, as it involves various system components. Investigation is ongoing, with teams monitoring Event ID 5016 and setting thresholds to track the delays in policy processing. This approach will help narrow down specific contributing factors, allowing for a more focused resolution strategy.
